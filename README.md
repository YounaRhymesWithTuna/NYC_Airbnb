# NYC_Airbnb
I analyzed the Airbnb data with Pandas & Python to learn what type of houses are favorable and the type of changes Airbnb can make to attract more guests. I then used a linear regression model to see how price is affected by the factors found in the csv file. 
The dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data.
